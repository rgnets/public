# Example code to use with the rXg Action Button App.
# Use the app to manually trigger Notification Actions
# and their events. 

# This template is for toggling the SSID of a
# particular WLAN. In this example, we're hosting 
# two different events at our arena on alternating
# days. We want to simply press a button toggle the name 
# of the SSID so it matches the correct event.

# To use this backend script, navigate to Services ::
# Notifcations. Add a Notfication Action with the event
# type set to manual. Then add a Backend Script and paste
# the following code into the body of the script, and 
# assign the notification action to the script. This 
# example requires a WLAN with the name "multi-purpose-arena" 
# and changes the SSID to "basketball_finals" if it is 
# set to "twice_world_tour" and vice versa.

# To watch this example be deployed, watch the following video:

NotificationAction:
- name: toggle_ssid
  event_type: manual
  backend_scripts:
  - toggle_ssid
# This toggle behavior can be adjusted to work with 
# several different scenarios. 
BackendScript:
- name: toggle_ssid
  body: |-
